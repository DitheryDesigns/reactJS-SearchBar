- **Customizable**: Easily integrate with your application and handle suggestion selection.
- **Styling**: Provides CSS classes for styling according to your application's design.

## Installation

2. Place them into your project's appropriate directory.

## Usage

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import SearchBar from './path/to/SearchBar';

function App() {
  const [suggestions, setSuggestions] = useState([]);
  const [searchValue, setSearchValue] = useState('');

  const handleInputChange = (value) => {
    // Update the input value as the user types
    setSearchValue(value);

    // Simulate fetching suggestions from a remote API
    fetchSuggestions(value);
  };

  const fetchSuggestions = (query) => {
    // Simulate fetching suggestions from a remote API based on the query
    // Replace this with your actual API call
    const apiUrl = `https://api.example.com/suggestions?q=${encodeURIComponent(query)}`;

    fetch(apiUrl)
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((data) => {
        // Assuming the API response is an array of suggestion strings

      })
      .catch((error) => {
        console.error('Error fetching suggestions:', error);
      });
  };
